				"The reactivity system introduced in Svelte 3 has made it easier than ever to trigger updates to the DOM. Despite this, there are a few simple rules that you must always follow. This guide explains how Svelteâ€™s reactivity system works, what you can and cannot do, as well a few pitfalls to avoid.",

				"### Top-level variables\n" +
				"The simplest way to make your Svelte components reactive is by using an assignment operator. Any time Svelte sees an assignment to a top-level variable an update is scheduled. A 'top-level variable' is any variable that is defined inside the script element but is not a child of anything, meaning, it is not inside a function or a block. Incidentally, these are also the only variables that you can reference in the DOM. Let's look at some examples.\n" +

				"The following works as expected and update the dom:\n" +
				"```html\n" +
				"<script>\n" +
				"\tlet num = 0;\n" +
				"\n" +
				"\tfunction updateNum() {\n" +
				"\t\tnum = 25;\n" +
				"\t}\n" +
				"</script>\n" +
				"\n" +
				"<button on:click={updateNum}>Update</button>\n" +
				"\n" +
				"<p>{num}</p>\n```\n" +
				"Svelte can see that there is an assignment to a top-level variable and knows to re-render after the num variable is modified.",
